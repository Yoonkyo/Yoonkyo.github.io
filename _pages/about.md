I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.umd.edu/) at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu/). I received my M.S. in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.snu.ac.kr/) from [Seoul National University](https://www.snu.ac.kr/), advised by [Prof. Ted "Taekyeong" Kwon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ruxWSFsAAAAJ&hl=en) and B.S. in System Engineering from the [Republic of Korea Air Force Academy](https://rokaf.airforce.mil.kr/afa/index.do). My research interests focus on robotics, LLM for wireless communication, AI for security, networking, and edge intelligence.
